## 👀 Introduction

Welcome to the repository for our survey paper, "Learning to Model the World: A Survey of World Models in Artificial Intelligence". This repository provides resources and updates related to our research. For a detailed introduction, please refer to [our survey paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.177274570.09578608/v1).

World models (WMs) provide a unified approach for modeling how environments evolve over time by learning predictive representations of states and observations. Recent advances in large-scale generative modeling and multimodal foundation models have substantially broadened their applicability across a wide range of interactive and multimodal domains; however, existing research remains fragmented across modeling paradigms, application domains, and evaluation protocols. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of WMs in artificial intelligence. Based on the world modeling paradigms of existing methods, we first categorize WMs into four major branches with formal mathematical formulations: reinforcement learning-based, observation-level generative, latent space, and object-centric world models. We further review a broad range of WM applications spanning robotics, autonomous driving, scientific discovery, virtual game simulation, GUI-based agents, as well as interpretability and trustworthiness, and summarize benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, simulation platforms, and comparative results across WMs. Finally, we discuss key challenges, including long-horizon consistency, controllability, robustness, evaluation limitations, and generalization, and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to offer a unified reference for understanding, comparing, and advancing WMs.
